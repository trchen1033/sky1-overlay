# Gentoo overlay for Cix Sky1 (CD8180) platform support

I'm only repackaging the great work by Entropi [here](https://github.com/Sky1-Linux).

This is still a WIP, only a kernel ebuild based on sys-kernel/vanilla-kernel.
The short term goal is to find a stable configuration and make a generic-uki kernel that will auto select DTB on all supported Sky1 boards.
